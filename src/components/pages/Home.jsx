      Hello, I'm Christian Flores, a Full Stack Developer currently exploring the United States with my wife and our 1 year old son. I have had the honor of serving in the U.S. Air Force for 6 years, and I've also worked as an IT Support Specialist for the United States District Courts for 3 years. Being a developer is not just rewarding in terms of creating innovative solutions, but it's also amazing how our code can impact the world, one line at a time.
